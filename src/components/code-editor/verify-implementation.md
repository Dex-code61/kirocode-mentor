### Next Steps:
The Monaco Editor integration is complete and ready for use. To integrate into the learning platform:

1. Import components from `@/components/code-editor`
2. Use `CodeEditorWithAnalysis` for full-featured coding exercises
3. Use `MonacoEditor` for simple code input scenarios
4. Customize validation rules based on exercise requirements

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Type check (should pass)
npm run type-check

# Test the implementation
# Navigate to /test-monaco in browser
# Click "Test Validator" button and check console
```

## ✅ Task 5 Status: COMPLETED

All requirements have been successfully implemented with additional enhancements for a professional coding experience.
